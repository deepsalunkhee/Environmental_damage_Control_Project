            <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">To the determination of furniture waste quantity,
diversity, and influence in the world and Turkey and
environmental aspects, and socio-economic effects,
taking into account the social aspect of this issue,
mainly used qualitative research methods in this study.
With the Documentary Method's help, which is one of
the qualitative research methods, the literature on the
subject has been researched and revealed. The standard
dimensions of the furniture used in the houses were
found, and the volume of the solid waste landfills was
determined. Determining the area to be covered by
furniture waste in terms of volume in storage areas
means that it will affect the waste storage areas' number
and life. Therefore, such a study is essential regarding
raising awareness of the role of furniture waste
concerning environmental pollution. One of the main
factors influencing the furniture consumption,
household income levels taking into account in Turkey,
observation method of qualitative research was applied
in Istanbul and Kocaeli, the highest household income
level o in the East Marmara Region. According to the
2019 TUIK data, the region with the lowest income
inequality is the Eastern Marmara region. The most
high-income province is Istanbul in Turkey (average
annual equivalent household used capita income of 40
thousand 749 pounds). Also, Kocaeli is the city with the
closest Gini coefficient to zero. These two cities are the
two significant metropolises of the Eastern Marmara
Region 11.</p>

<p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Furniture used in areas such as houses, offices, schools
that have reached the end of their lives or are broken in
a state that cannot be used is discarded and treated or
disposed of differently depending on the country. These
wastes are being used or disposed of in various ways by
the relevant countries. According to research being
conducted, it was determined that 80-90% of the
furniture that is purchased is disposed of after the first
six months period of owning them [24]. When furniture
wastes in literature are examined, it is seen that wastes
come out during the production phase and the usage
phase. For example, it is being stated that nearly onefourth of total furniture wastes being produced in the
world are produced in European Community countries.
More than 10 million furniture is being disposed of by producers each year and consumers in EU countries,
and these wastes are disposed of at regular storage
fields or burned [25]. In the year 2010, 4.1 megaton
wood waste has occurred in England; these are reported
to be 0.4 megatons of furniture waste [26]. 88% of the
wastes generated during the production phase in
furniture factories in Brazil have been reported as wood
and the rest as metal, plastic, fabric, paper/cardboard
[27]. In France, 2 million tons of furniture wastes occur
each year, and most of these wastes are being burned or
disposed of in common storage areas [28]. According
to a study being conducted in Ireland, it has been stated
that most of the furniture wastes being part of urban
wastes have features enabling them to be reused [28].
In Belgium, nearly 50 thousand tons of wastes occur
each year, including house goods and furniture [29]. In
a study conducted in metropolitan regions of Australia
as covering more than 2500 pieces of households, it
was reached to the data that 24 kgs of furniture wastes
occur each year per household. It was determined in a
study that when these data were transformed into
figures, they were equivalent to 800 thousand sofas,
1.65 million dining tables, 3.4 million coffee tables, and
6.85 million chairs [30]. When it was looked at the
United States of America, it is seen that in the report
being prepared by EPA (the United States
Environmental Protection Agency), it is predicted that
9.8 million tons of furniture wastes come out each year.
When the sources in literature are examined, it is seen
that it is specified that nearly 100 thousand tons of
furniture wastes occur each year in Finland and that 70-
80% of these wastes have features enabling them to be
improved and reused [31, 32].</p>

            </h1>
            <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">    In the woodworks and furniture sector, usage of raw
materials, production process, and distribution of
products, their being burned after completion of their
usage lifetimes, or their being reused for various
purposes causes very different environmental impacts.
The life cycle of furniture takes place in successive
stages, from the forest to the end product furniture
production, and the aging of furniture during its use.
Afterward, these materials can be burned or used by
recycling. Furniture that is considered among durable
consumption goods is produced in various numbers and
types, and their usage lifetimes show variations. This
period is 10-15 years on average, but it can be as much
as 50 years. After cutting trees, which are the raw
materials of furniture products, chemicals such as wax
emulsion, polyvinyl emulsion, and aluminium are used
on the timber ends.</p>
